- ### Structure
    The website is designed to be consistent, intuitive and learnable.
  - Interaction design
    - For predictability, the interface interacts with user actions as the user expects. The scroll/swipe actions respond with the normal behaviour and buttons acts instantly on press.
    - For consistency, the interface offers a subtle visual feedback to the user (on hover, focus and press of buttons and fields) which is similar throughout the application and helps the user to quickly learn the functionality.
  - Information architecture
    - The content is organised and prioritised by importance from top to bottom and left to right.
    - For consistency, the information is presented in the rule of 3 on large screens and individual on small screens.
    - The information is structured mostly in nested lists.

  - ### Improvements
    - #### **Client Side**:
      - **All pages**: Breadcrumbs between header and content
  
        ![Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/breadcrumbs.png) 
      - **Landing page**: Icons for education and experience items, but no icon for testimonials.
      - **Blog Post page**: The post cover photo is displayed on the left.
      - **Contact page**: Profile Picture is displayed instead of person icon and is not hidden on mobile.
    - #### **Admin Panel**:
      - #### All pages:
        - The layout is completely separate and different from the client side, different navbar which only includes **App** and **Logout** buttons and the menu panel is now a full height sidebar, no footer.
        - On mobile, the menu is expandable from the navbar, and it covers the whole page.
        - A svg image on the top right of every page (centred on mobile), representing the page's subject.
      - #### Dashboard:
        - Login page.
          
          ![Login](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/login.png) 
        - Notifications panel is displayed in yellow and only if there are notifications.
        - Extra panel with quick links.

          ![Dashboard](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/dashboard.png) 
      - #### Get Items (list) page
        - Preview button for blogs and projects and no edit button for testimonials, skills and links.
      - #### Update (item) page and Settings page
        - There is a new panel for the drag&drop photo upload on blog and project edit page and on settings page, displayed beside the initial form.

          ![Dashboard](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/photos-upload.png) 
- ### Design Choices 
  - #### Colours
    - The colour palette consists of different shades of blue inspired by the "Colours of Santorini".  
    ![Colour Palette](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/palette.png)
    - According to [The Psychology of Color](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/color-in-ux), the chosen colours represent optimism, loyalty and reliability.
    ![Colour Psychology Wheel](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/colour-wheel.jpg)  
    - The 60-30-10 Rule was also taken into consideration when building the project. The light shades which are used mostly for background are considered neutral and makes up to 60% of the palette. The dark shades are complementary and makes up to 30%, while the accent colours completes the remaining 10% of the design. The landing page is an exception to this rule, as it is divided into multiple sections and uses all colours to create contrast between these.
  - #### Typography
    There are three fonts used throughout the project. Two main fonts used for content and headings, both having a ```sans-serif``` typeface and fallback. These font-faces inspire a clean and modern aspect. The third font is a ```monospace``` typeface used for brand text (logo) only to make it look like a piece of code:
    - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) is used as a general font.
    - [Alegreya Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans?query=Alegreya+Sans) is used for h1, h2 and h3 headings.
    - [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=Source+Code+Pro) is used for brand text, and it has a ```monospace``` fallback.
  - #### Media
    The only media used on building this project are svg (inline html paths) section separators on the client side, svg minimalistic images on admin panel on top of every page and a ***"no-photo"*** image used as a fallback for any image issue. Any other media found on the app is added through the admin panel and is relevant to its container.
  - #### Iconography
    Icons are used throughout the project to help the user understand more efficiently the meaning of the content. They are a very good asset to improve UX.

    ![Contact email](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/email-template.png)

## Database
  All the information in the database is only in relation with showcased developer. Therefore, the database used for this project is the document-based database **MongoDB** as a relational database is not needed.
  - ### Schema
    ![DB Schema](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/db_schema.png)

    > This database schema is mostly self-explanatory. For a better understanding: 
    > - **settings** document: ***cover*** field is for the long bio (or cover letter) text.
    > - **blogs** document: ***slug*** field is a unique identifying string, generated from title, used for accessing the document from URL.
    > - **education** and **experience** documents: ***order*** field is for sorting purposes when displaying records.
    > - **projects** document: ***slug*** field is an unique identifying string, generated from title, used for accessing the document from URL. ***brief*** is the short description, displayed on project lists, while ***description*** is the long rich-text description, containing html tags as well.
    > - **links** document: ***icon*** field is for the bootstrap icon name extracted from the class, e.g.: ```github``` from ```<i class="bi bi-github"></i>```.

## Deployment
- ### Forking the GitHub Repository
  By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi).
  2. At the top right of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate and click the "**Fork**" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- ### Local Machine
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi) (or the forked repo into your profile).
  2. At the top of the Repository just above the list of files, locate and click the "**Code**" dropdown.
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "**Clone**", make sure "**HTTPS**" is selected and copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi.git
      ```
  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
      ```bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi.git
      Cloning into 'dev.pi'...
